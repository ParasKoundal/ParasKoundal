## Current Projects

- 🛰️ **Multiple ML Works @ IceCube Observatory** – Architecting multiple Graph Neural Networks, CNN and other ML method pipelines and models for reconstruction of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) in Antarctica.
- 🐚 **[TalkToCode](https://github.com/paraskoundal/talktocode)** (Public Soon) – Local-first AI coding assistant. Chat with your codebase privately using RAG and open-source LLMs.
- 🖥 **[Shello](https://github.com/ParasKoundal/Shello)** & **[ShelloHub](https://github.com/ParasKoundal/ShelloHub)** - Turns any Linux server into a secure, browser-accessible terminal, bypassing the need for VPNs, port forwarding, or root privileges. Also a combined dashboard to manage multiple Shello instances
- 📚 **[ShelfScan](https://github.com/ParasKoundal/Shello)** (Public Soon) - Scan any shelf to automatically read book titles, categorize, give ratings etc and locate any specific item on the shelf. This is built out of pain of finding good books at GoodWill.
- ֎ **[GPT Search](https://github.com/ParasKoundal/GPTSearch)** - Prompt ChatGPT directly from your browser's address bar 
- 💼 **[Job Tracker](https://github.com/ParasKoundal/JobTracker)** - Track job applications with one click. Never lose track of where you applied.
- 📝 **[Git Notes](https://github.com/ParasKoundal/GitNotes)** - Context-aware notes for your GitHub repositories.
- 🐷 **[Training Script Runner](https://github.com/ParasKoundal/TrainingScriptRunner)** - Stop "fat-fingering" terminal arguments

## Engineering & Research

- **Geometric Deep Learning** – Focused on the application of GNNs to radio astronomy and particle reconstruction.
- **Quantitative Finance** – Exploring the intersection of ML and high-frequency trading.
- **AI SaaS Architecture** – Rapidly prototyping AI-native products with a focus on local inference.
